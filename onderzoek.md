Problem 1: Support is too expensive. 

Each humanities researcher who wants to do digital research requests a ICT expert to do the development and technical implementation of the experimental research. This brings two problems:
1. The humanities scholars themselves remain lacking in ICT skills and have limited understanding of the technical work and its consequences for making scholarly arugments. 
2. For every researchers, an ICT expert is needed to do all the technical work, which would require a large number of experts. There are no financial means to support this and it is a very inefficient way to make use of ICT expertise. 
3. Advising on tool use and applying tools on data require both understanding of the tools and the data they operate on. The technical support needs to be informed with domain knowledge to be able to work properly on the data and make decisions and give advice on how to use tools, set parameters and interpret results.

Many technical needs are similar, but without training the humanities researchers themselves and way to pass on the built up expertise to others, the two problems mentioned above remian. We believe the most effective solution to both problems is to train humanities reseachers.

## Turn support into training

The IC department offers technical support for researchers, but has limited insight into the needs of researchers. Researchers often ask for specific hardware and software, but this doesn't tell the IC department what problems the researchers are trying to solve. Their support is therefore limited to installing and advising on hard- and software. 

There are many online platforms that offer support. Stack Overflow is a forum where programmers ask and answer questions. There is no need for a large team of permanent support. The programmers help each other. The solution to the technical problems of a large crowd of non-technical scholars is to get them to collaborate and train each other.

We plan to do this with two complementary 

1. online: platform for collaboration
2. offline: lab for collaboration

## Platform

Researchers start looking for support on the platform, which offers them training on to solve their problems themselves and an environment where they can develop their skills and technical research collaboratively. 

## Lab for collaboration

To facilitate collaboration, the lab needs the following requirements:
+ it should be open and accessible
+ it should be flexible, as project group sizes and type of work vary
+ it should have whiteboards to collaboratively think up and write out ideas. Whiteboards are thinking tools. By quickly writing down ideas, these ideas take shape. The advantage of a whiteboard is that multiple people can see, add to, modify and remove what's being writting.

The challenges is how to get humanities researchers to collaborate. 

## Research needed

+ develop an setup pilot lab
  + hours
  + materials (whiteboards, etc)
  + space
+ representation costs to acquire funding from external parties
+ communication
+ training courses

Solution 2: use Expert ICT Desk for dealing with non-standard requests
+ Loket non-standard technical ICT problems (on- and offline) can 
  + channel support for similar needs to similar solutions
  + get an overview of what the needs are
  + give advice to researchers on how to train themselves
